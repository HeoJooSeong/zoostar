The rate coefficients for associative detachment, leading to H2O + e-, increase with decreasing temperature and reach a flat maximum of 1.8 x 10-9 cm\\xb3 s-1 at temperatures between 20 K and 80 K. There, the overall reaction probability is in good agreement with a capture model indicating efficient non-adiabatic couplings between the entrance potential energy surfaces. Classical trajectory calculations on newly calculated potential energy surfaces as well as the topology of the conical intersection seam leading to the neutral surface corroborate this. The formation of OH- + H via hydrogen transfer, although occurring with a probability of a few percent only (about 5 x 10-11 cm\\xb3 s-1 at temperatures 10-300 K), indicates that there are reaction paths, where electron detachment is avoided.

      "Row(abstractPaper=u'Reactive collisions between O- and H2 have been studied experimentally at temperatures ranging from 10 K to 300 K using a cryogenic radiofrequency 22-pole ion trap. The rate coefficients for associative detachment, leading to H2O + e-, increase with decreasing temperature and reach a flat maximum of 1.8 x 10-9 cm\\xb3 s-1 at temperatures between 20 K and 80 K. There, the overall reaction probability is in good agreement with a capture model indicating efficient non-adiabatic couplings between the entrance potential energy surfaces. Classical trajectory calculations on newly calculated potential energy surfaces as well as the topology of the conical intersection seam leading to the neutral surface corroborate this. The formation of OH- + H via hydrogen transfer, although occurring with a probability of a few percent only (about 5 x 10-11 cm\\xb3 s-1 at temperatures 10-300 K), indicates that there are reaction paths, where electron detachment is avoided.

       " Row(id=192033, manuscriptId=861610, abstractPaper=u\"Energy efficiency has become a very important issue to be addressed in today's system-on-a-chip (SoC) designs. One way to lower power consumption is to reduce the supply voltage. Multisupply voltage (MSV) is thus introduced to provide flexibility in controlling the power and performance tradeoff. In region-based MSV, circuits are partitioned into \\xc2\\xbfvoltage islands\\xc2\\xbf where each island occupies a contiguous physical space and operates at one voltage level. These tasks of island partitioning and voltage level assignment should be done simultaneously in the floorplanning process in order to take those important physical information into consideration. In this paper, we consider this core-based voltage island driven floorplanning problem including islands with power down mode, and propose a method to solve it. Given a candidate floorplan solution represented by a normalized Polish expression, we are able to obtain optimal voltage assignment and island partitioning (including islands with power down mode) simultaneously to minimize the total power consumption. Simulated annealing is used as the basic searching engine. By using this approach, we can achieve significant power saving (up to 50%) for all datasets, without any significant increase in area and wire length. We compared our approach with the most updated previous work on the same problem, and results show that our approach is much more efficient and is able to save more power in most cases. We have also studied two other approaches to solve the same problem, a simple dynamic programming approach and a lowest possible power consumption approach. Experimental results show that ours can perform the best among these three approaches. Our floorplanner can also be extended to minimize the number of level shifters, to address a minVdd version of the problem and to simplify the power routing step by placing islands close to their corresponding power pins.\", saveSource=u'IEEE', saveTimestamp=datetime.datetime(2016, 6, 30, 11, 31)),\n",

The edges can be sharper when the ELA-median directional interpolation is adopted. The same-parity 4-field horizontal motion detection detects faster motion and makes more accurate determinations about where objects are going to move. The morphological operation for noise reduction and adaptive threshold adjusting preserve the actual texture of the original objects. The proposed method achieves cost-efficient hardware implementation with low complexity, low memory usage, and high-speed processing capability.

In these speech-centric applications, the output of ASR as \\u201cnoisy\\u201d text is fed into down-stream processing systems to accomplish the designated tasks of translation, information retrieval, or natural language understanding, etc. In conventional applications, the ASR model as a sub-system is usually trained without considering the down-stream systems. This often leads to sub-optimal end-to-end performance. In this paper, we propose a unifying end-to-end optimization framework in which the model parameters in all sub-systems including ASR are learned by Extended Baum-Welch (EBW) algorithms via optimizing the criteria directly tied to the end-to-end performance measure. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a speech translation task using the spoken language translation benchmark test of IWSLT. Our experimental results show that the proposed method leads to significant improvement of translation quality over the conventional techniques based on separate modular sub-system design.

We propose a new scheduling framework, which extends conventional short-term scheduling with long-term QoS information from previously traversed cells.

This basic operation has been used in various variants, like sifting and window permutation. In this paper, we show that lower bounds computed during the minimization process can speed up the computation significantly. First, lower bounds are studied from a theoretical point of view.

However, there are two implementation issues, namely, the interference and backhaul issues. To resolve these issues, we propose a novel network architecture called the backhaul-limited cached dense wireless network (C-DWN), where a physical layer (PHY) caching scheme is employed at the base stations (BSs), but only a fraction of the BSs have wired payload backhauls. The PHY caching can replace the role of wired backhauls to achieve both the cache-induced multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) cooperation gain and cache-assisted multihopping gain. Two fundamental questions are addressed. Can we exploit the PHY caching to achieve linear capacity scaling with limited payload backhauls? If so, how much cache is needed? We show that the capacity of the backhaul-limited C-DWN indeed scales linearly with the number of BSs if the BS cache size is larger than a threshold that depends on the content popularity. We also quantify the throughput gain due to cache-induced MIMO cooperation over conventional caching schemes (which exploit purely the cached-assisted multihopping). Interestingly, the minimum BS cache size needed to achieve a significant cache-induced MIMO cooperation gain is the same as that needed to achieve the linear capacity scaling.', saveSource=u'IEEE', saveTimestamp=datetime.datetime(2016, 7, 1, 8, 28, 31)),\n",

These regions may contain objects semantically different to buildings but with a highly similar edge distribution, e.g., high frequency of vertical and horizontal edges. Using these observations a strategy is devised in which a fuzzy rule-based classification technique is combined with a method for changing region detection in outdoor scenes. The proposed approach has been implemented and tested with sequences showing changes in the lighting conditions.

However, the accuracy of current devices is still poor and it may partly depend on low performance of the implemented calibration algorithm. Here, a new adaptive calibration algorithm based on a population local-model-based inter-compartmental glucose dynamic model is proposed. The novelty consists in the adaptation of data normalization parameters in real time to estimate and compensate patient's sensitivity variations. Adaptation is performed to minimize mean absolute relative deviation at the calibration points with a time window forgetting strategy. Four calibrations are used: preprandial and 1.5 h postprandial at two different meals. Two databases are used for validation: 1) a 9-h CGMS Gold (Medtronic, Northridge, USA) time series with paired reference glucose values from a clinical study in 17 subjects with type 1 diabetes; 2) data from 30 virtual patients (UVa simulator, Virginia, USA), where inter- and intrasubject variability of sensor's sensitivity were simulated. Results show how the adaptation of the normalization parameters improves the performance of the calibration algorithm since it counteracts sensor sensitivity variations.

The ultrasound probe is installed on a mechanical arm, and continuously scans fragmental images along the body surface. A wide-area cross-sectional image is then constructed using the measured images. The link mechanism is very flexible, enabling the operator to measure images for any body posture and body site.

Hence, different VQs may show different training properties, even though the VQs are designed for the same TS. A numerical comparison of trained VQs is then conducted in conjunction with deriving their training ratios. Through the comparison, it is shown that structured VQs can achieve better performance than the full-search scheme if the codebooks are trained by a finite TS. Further, we can derive a design or comparison guideline that maintains equal training ratios in training different VQs.', saveSource=u'IEEE', saveTimestamp=datetime.datetime(2016, 7, 1, 9, 40, 22)),\n",

This paper proposes a virtual force directed coevolutionary particle swarm optimization (VFCPSO) algorithm, which uses a combined objective function to achieve the tradeoff of coverage and energy consumption. By considering deployment as an optimization problem, VFCPSO is more reliable and flexible for WSNs, since it can satisfy the combined requirements instead of only enlarging coverage.

In this oxidation process, the current measurement is required to control the thickness of the obtained aluminum oxide, the most important parameter in determining the overall quality of the process. Starting from the features of the considered process, the transducer must measure, without contact, dc currents up to 13 kA in continuous aluminum strips, whose width and thickness can be up to 1600 and 5 mm, respectively; the mass of each coil can be greater than 4700 kg, and the length can be more than 800 m.

It is well known that a simple differential detection already results in a high error floor for moderate time and frequency selectivities of the channel.

In this paper, we consider the DSFM for the MIMO-OFDM transmission and MSDD at the receiver.

The wrapper approach is largely unsuitable in real-world applications due to its heavy reliance on clustering algorithms that require parameters such as the number of clusters, and the lack of suitable clustering criteria to evaluate clustering in different subspaces. In this paper we propose a 'filter' method that is independent of any clustering algorithm. The proposed method is based on the observation that data with clusters has a very different point-to-point distance histogram to that of data without clusters. By exploiting this we propose an entropy measure that is low if data has distinct clusters and high if it does not. The entropy measure is suitable for selecting the most important subset of features because it is invariant with the number of dimensions, and is affected only by the quality of clustering. Extensive performance evaluation over synthetic, benchmark, and real datasets shows its effectiveness.\", saveSource=u'IEEE', saveTimestamp=datetime.datetime(2016, 7, 1, 10, 24, 55)),\n",

Previous work has considered the problem from two perspectives: devising practical heuristics for the case of cooperative peers and performing game-theoretic analysis for the case of selfish peers. In this paper, we unify the aforementioned thrusts by defining and studying the selfish neighbor selection (SNS) game and its application to overlay routing. At the heart of SNS stands the restriction that peers are allowed up to a certain number of neighbors. This makes SNS substantially different from existing network formation games that impose no bounds on peer degrees. Having bounded degrees has important practical consequences as it permits the creation of overlay structures that require <i>O</i>(<i>n</i>) instead of <i>O</i>(<i>n</i><sup>2</sup>) link monitoring overhead. We show that a node's \\u201cbest response\\u201d wiring strategy amounts to solving a <i>k</i> -median problem on asymmetric distance. Best-response wirings have substantial practical utility as they permit selfish nodes to reap substantial performance benefits when connecting to overlays of nonselfish nodes. A more intricate consequence is that even nonselfish nodes can benefit from the existence of some selfish nodes since the latter, via their local optimizations, create a highly optimized backbone, upon which even simple heuristic wirings yield good performance. To capitalize on the above properties, we design, build, and deploy EGOIST, an SNS-inspired prototype overlay routing system for PlanetLab.

This paper proposes a practical multiagent-based approach, which is designed to achieve acceptable route allocation within a short time frame and with low communication overheads. In the proposed approach, which is called Congestion Avoidance and Route Allocation using Virtual Agent Negotiation (CARAVAN), vehicle agents (VAs) in the local vicinity communicate with each other before designated decision points (junctions) along their route. Cooperative route-allocation decisions are performed at these junctions. VAs use intervehicular communication to propagate key traffic information and undertake its distributed processing.

The network has different sets of weights that define the input, hidden, and output layers, of which only the output set is adapted for every new sample to be processed. The performance is evaluated on ECG signals, with simulated f-waves added, by determining the root mean square error between the true f-wave signal and the estimated signal, as well as by evaluating the dominant AF frequency. When compared to average beat subtraction (ABS), being the most widely used method for QRST cancellation, the performance is found to be significantly better with an error reduction factor of 0.24-0.43, depending on f-wave amplitude.

The knowledge of this null space enables the SU to transmit in the same band simultaneously with the PU by utilizing separate spatial dimensions than the PU. Specifically, the SU transmits in the null space of the interference channel to the PU. We present a new algorithm, called the one-bit null space learning algorithm (OBNSLA), in which the SU learns the PU's null space by observing a binary function that indicates whether the interference it inflicts on the PU has increased or decreased in comparison to the SU's previous transmitted signal. This function is obtained by listening to the PU transmitted signal or control channel and extracting information from it about whether the PU's signal-to-interference-plus-noise power ratio (SINR) has increased or decreased. The OBNSLA is shown to have a linear convergence rate and an asymptotic quadratic convergence rate. Finally, we derive bounds on the interference that the SU inflicts on the PU as a function of a parameter determined by the SU.

The high-band energy is then used to select a suitable high-band spectral envelope shape that is consistent with the estimated high-band energy while simultaneously ensuring that the resulting wide-band spectral envelope is continuous at the boundary between narrow-band and high-band. The scalar high-band energy parameter thus effectively controls the artificial information added to the high-band of the bandwidth extended output speech signal.

An algorithm is combinatorial if only direct comparisons between two pairwise similarity values are allowed. Namely, the input dataset is represented by a comparison oracle that given any three points X,Y,Z answers whether Y or Z is closer to X. We assume that the similarity order of the dataset satisfies the four variations of the following disorder inequality: if X is the A'th most similar object to Y and Y is the B'th most similar object to Z, then X is among the D(A + B) most similar objects to Z, where D is a relatively small disorder constant. Combinatorial algorithms for nearest neighbor search have two important advantages: (1) they do not map similarity values to artificial distance values and do not use triangle inequality for the latter, and (2) they work for arbitrarily complicated data representations and similarity functions. Ranwalk, the first known combinatorial solution for nearest neighbors, is randomized, exact, zero-error algorithm with query time that is logarithmic in number of objects. But Ranwalk preprocessing time is quadratic. Later on, another solution, called combinatorial nets, was discovered. It is deterministic and exact algorithm with almost linear time and space complexity of preprocessing, and near-logarithmic time complexity of search. Combinatorial nets also have a number of side applications. For near-duplicate detection they lead to the first known deterministic algorithm that requires just near-linear time + time proportional to the size of output. For any dataset with small disorder combinatorial nets can be used to construct a visibility graph: the one in which greedy routing deterministically converges to the nearest neighbor of a target in logarithmic number of steps.

The conventional method for sending speech across a mobile or IP network is to encode the speech on the terminal device using a low bit-rate codec and then transmit the stream of codec parameters. It is shown in this work that for speech recognition applications an alternative is available whereby the front-end processing part of a network-based speech recogniser is detached and moved onto the terminal device. Recognition features are then sent over the network to the remote recogniser. Simulations demonstrate that sending the speech features in this manner can provide a significant enhancement in recognition performance over the traditional codec-based approach. This technique forms the basis of the ETSI (European Telecommunications Standards Institute) Aurora standard. Problems arising with access over IP networks are also considered and in particular that of packet loss.

To address the deadlock problem without compromising communication latency and the incremental expansion capability that irregular networks can offer, we propose a simple topology called extended incremental triangular mesh (EITM) for switch-based networks.

Many recent Web server systems have been developed as cluster systems, but such systems are so complicated that important information for appropriate distribution decisions is in higher layer (i.e., application layer, or layer-7). Although the L7 switches are appliances that can redirect requests by examining the application-layer information, it is difficult to update or modify their distribution algorithms. This paper proposes a novel architecture based on TCP-migration mechanism that provides complete redirection (displacement) of a TCP session from a dispatcher to Web servers. The key idea is physical separation of L7 switch functionality: packet forwarding and request dispatching mechanisms. With NAT mechanism on the L3 switch and sophisticated management of virtual private IP addresses on the cluster servers, the dispatcher is released from relaying or translating both in-bound and out-bound TCP packets after the request has been redirected. This architecture can achieve greater flexibility because the forwarding is performed fast by hardware (i.e., the switch), and the dispatching is managed by software (i.e., application servers). We have designed and implemented this mechanism on Linux 2.4 kernel and evaluated its performance.

Traveling at constant speed, the agents achieve and maintain their formation by using small steering adjustments to equalize the distance between themselves and their respective leading and following neighbors. Since the formation moves around a common loop, an agent can move forward or back in formation by respectively steering slighting inside or outside the reference loop. These adjustments are controlled with the use of variable radius parameters for each agent that are shown to converge to the desired reference loop as equal spacing is achieved. We show that the proposed controller renders the desired formation locally asymptotically stable and provide simulations to demonstrate the performance of the controller for an example scenario in which the formation must recover from the loss of an agent.', saveSource=u'IEEE', saveTimestamp=datetime.datetime(2016, 7, 1, 13, 54, 59)),\n",

However, in any practical scenario, nodes generally communicate with a small subset of nodes and thus exhaustively estimating the trust of all the nodes can lead to huge resource consumption. In contrast, our mechanism can be tuned to locate a desired subset of trusted nodes, based on the allowable overhead, with respect to a particular user.

Similar to OFDMA downlink, SC-FDMA enables multiple UEs to be served simultaneously in uplink as well.

Moreover, a UE should adopt the same modulation and coding scheme at all allocated subcarriers. These two constraints do limit the scheduling flexibility.

This objective function coincides asymptotically with the maximum likelihood (ML) objective function, hence enabling the proposed algorithm to asymptotically approach the ML estimation performance. In the proposed method, the rows of the AJD matrix are obtained independently, in an iterative manner. This feature enables direct estimation of full row-rank rectangular AJD sub-matrices.

A transmitter onboard the first LEO satellite and a receiver onboard the second one are required. The NDSA approach is based on the simultaneous estimates of the total attenuation at two relatively close frequencies in the Ku/K-bands and of a \"spectral sensitivity parameter\" that can be directly converted into IWV. The spectral sensitivity has the potential to determine the water vapor contribution, to cancel out all spectrally flat unwanted contributions, and to limit the impairments due to tropospheric scintillation. In this paper, we focus on the measurement accuracy of the spectral sensitivity parameter.

When AT&amp;T bid on the US federal government's new private network called FTS-2000, it was clear that competition between service providers bidding on this contract would be intense. To win this contract, it was realized that this network would have to be robust, reliable, provide a wide array of services, and be very efficient. It was therefore decided to adopt a dynamic nonhierarchical routing (DNHR) traffic architecture, which had proved economical and successful in the AT&amp;T public switched network during the mid-1980s. In this case DNHR had to be adapted to the eighteen 5ESS <sup>TM</sup> switches which would form the backbone of the FTS-2000 network. The adapted routing strategy was called DFR, dynamic flexible routing, which like DNHR took advantage of diverse customer calling patterns over a wide geographical area in this nationwide network serving four time zones. Due to the substantial increase in the network load the planners realized the need for an agile, short-term planning tool adapted to the volatile FTS-2000 environment, and thus the system called PATTERNS was developed.

Here, we describe an automated tracking method that uses particle filtering to implement a recursive Bayesian estimation of the filament location in successive frames of video sequences. To increase the efficiency of this approach, we take advantage of the fact that neurofilament movement is confined within the boundaries of the axon. We use piecewise cubic spline interpolation to model the path of the axon and then we use this model to limit both the orientation and location of the neurofilament in the particle tracking algorithm. Based on these two spatial constraints, we develop a prior dynamic state model that generates significantly fewer particles than generic particle filtering, and we select an adequate observation model to produce a robust tracking method. We demonstrate the efficacy and efficiency of our method by performing tracking experiments on real time-lapse image sequences of neurofilament movement, and we show that the method performs well compared to manual tracking by an experienced user.

We assume that the spectrum band is partitioned into <i>C</i> frequency bins, and whenever all are occupied, spectrum access by secondary radio (SR) will be blocked. On the other hand, an SR transmission is forced to terminate whenever a primary radio (PR) transmission is detected in the same frequency bin. The grade of service (GoS) of the secondary system is quantified by the SR service dropped and SR service blocked probabilities. We model each scheme using a continuous-time Markov chain and derive the expressions to compute the two GoS performance metrics. In the first scheme, the PRs randomly access the frequency bins with no knowledge about the presence of SRs. Therefore, the existing SR transmission has to drop whenever a PR chooses to transmit in the same frequency bin, although there are other unoccupied frequency bins. For the second scheme, the newly arrived PR will avoid colliding with existing SRs by occupying the vacant frequency bin. In the third scheme, the newly arrived SR is limited to access <i>C</i> - <i>r</i> frequency bins only, where <i>r</i> can flexibly be selected to optimize the amount of supported SR traffic.

In this paper we share our experience in applying various source code analysis techniques for assessing the quality of and detecting potential defects in a large mission-critical software system. The case study is about the maintenance of a software system of a Bulgarian government agency. The system has been developed by a third-party software vendor over a period of four years. The development produced over 4 million LOC using more than 20 technologies. Musala Soft won a tender for maintaining this system in 2008. Although the system was operational, there were various issues that were known to its users. So, a decision was made to assess the system's quality with various source code analysis tools. The expectation was that the findings will reveal some of the problems' cause, allowing us to correct the issues and thus improve the quality and focus on functional enhancements. Musala Soft had already established a special unit - Applied Research and Development Center - dealing with research and advancements in the area of software system analysis. Thus, a natural next step was for this unit to use the know-how and in-house developed tools to do the assessment. The team used various techniques that had been subject to intense research, more precisely: software metrics, code clone detection, defect and \\u201ccode smells\\u201d detection through flow-sensitive and points-to analysis, software visualization and graph drawing. In addition to the open-source and free commercial tools, the team used internally developed ones that complement or improve what was available. The internally developed Smart Source Analyzer platform that was used is focused on several analysis areas: source code modeling, allowing easy navigation through the code elements and relations for different programming languages; quality audit through software metri- s by aggregating various metrics into a more meaningful quality characteristic (e.g. \\u201cmaintainability\\u201d); source code pattern recognition - to detect various security issues and \\u201ccode smells\\u201d. The produced results presented information about both the structure of the system and its quality. As the analysis was executed in the beginning of the maintenance tenure, it was vital for the team members to quickly grasp the architecture and the business logic. On the other hand, it was important to review the detected quality problems as this guided the team to quick solutions for the existing issues and also highlighted areas that would impede future improvements. The tool IPlasma and its System Complexity View (Fig. 1) revealed where the business logic is concentrated, which are the most important and which are the most complex elements of the system.

Our aim is to minimize the total discounted energy consumption of the HCN while maintaining the quality-of-service (QoS) experienced by mobile users. For each cell (i.e., a macro cell or a small cell), the energy consumption is determined by its system load, which is coupled with system loads in other cells due to the sharing over a common frequency band. We model the energy-aware traffic offloading problem in such HCNs as a discrete-time Markov decision process (DTMDP). Based on the traffic observations and the traffic offloading operations, the network controller gradually optimizes the traffic offloading strategy with no prior knowledge of the DTMDP statistics.

Challenging yet open questions are how fast and how far a packet can be delivered in such networks, in temporal and spatial domains, respectively. The answers to these questions offer a straightforward interpretation of the potentials of CRNs for time-sensitive applications. To tackle these questions, we define two metrics, dissemination radius \\u2225\\u2112(t)\\u2225 and propagation speed S(d). The former is the maximum Euclidean distance that a packet can reach in time t, and the latter is the speed that a packet transmits between a source and destination at Euclidean distance d apart, which can be used to measure the transmission delay. Further, we determine the sufficient and necessary conditions under which there exist spatial and temporal limits of information dissemination in CRNs. We find that when information cannot be disseminated to the entire network, the limiting dissemination radius is statistically dominated by an exponential distribution, while the limiting information propagation speed approaches to zero.

Traditionally, regularization is conducted by including an additional term in the cost function of a learning algorithm. One main drawback of these regularization techniques is that a hyperparameter that determines to which extension the regularization influences the learning algorithm must be determined beforehand. This paper addresses the neural network regularization problem from a multi-objective optimization point of view. During the optimization, both structure and parameters of the neural network will be optimized. A slightly modified version of two multi-objective optimization algorithms, the dynamic weighted aggregation (DWA) method and the elitist non-dominated sorting genetic algorithm (NSGA-II) are used and compared. An evolutionary multi-objective approach to neural network regularization has a number of advantages compared to the traditional methods. First, a number of models with a spectrum of model complexity can be obtained in one optimization run instead of only one single solution. Second, an efficient new regularization term can be introduced, which is not applicable to gradient-based learning algorithms. As a natural by-product of the multi-objective optimization approach to neural network regularization, neural network ensembles can be easily constructed using the obtained networks with different levels of model complexity. Thus, the model complexity of the ensemble can be adjusted by adjusting the weight of each member network in the ensemble.

       " Row(id=193351, manuscriptId=2752888, abstractPaper=u'In traditional cellular networks with fixed base stations, the channel reuse pattern is static and deterministic. When the cell layout is dynamic, due to the mobility of base stations, the cluster of cells within cochannel interference range changes with time. Consequently, the channel reuse pattern is highly dynamic. Moreover, base stations also need wireless channels to communicate amongst themselves. A communication session between a pair of nodes may have to switch channels due to the movement of other nodes into the neighborhood. None of the existing dynamic channel allocation algorithms for cellular networks works in such a system. Hence, there is a need for new wireless channel allocation algorithms for virtual cellular networks with mobile base stations. In this paper, principles of mutual exclusion pertaining to distributed computing systems are employed to develop such an algorithm. The inter-base-station wireless links are referred to as backbone links, while the base station to mobile node links are referred to as short-hop links. The proposed algorithm is distributed, dynamic, and deadlock-free. Disjoint sets of channels are used for backbone and short-hop links. The distributed nature of the channel allocation scheme leads to scalability and robustness, as the responsibility is no longer centralized at the mobile telecommunications switching office (MTSO). Instead, it is shared among all the mobile base stations. In addition, the issue of channel rearrangement is addressed. Channel rearrangement is the switching of channels, performed to prevent cochannel interference, when mobile base stations using the same channels, hitherto not in interference range, come within the range of each other. If multiple channels are available to support a communication session, the channel selection policy can have a significant impact on performance. A random selection from the set of available channels yields better performance at low to moderate channel demand. This is in contrast to ordered channel selection (from one end of the spectrum), which always yields the best performance for cellular networks.

Prior work on firewall optimization focuses on either intra-firewall or inter-firewall optimization within one administrative domain where the privacy of firewall policies is not a concern. This paper explores inter-firewall optimization across administrative domains for the first time. The key technical challenge is that firewall policies cannot be shared across domains because a firewall policy contains confidential information and even potential security holes, which can be exploited by attackers. In this paper, we propose the first cross-domain privacy-preserving cooperative firewall policy optimization protocol. Specifically, for any two adjacent firewalls belonging to two different administrative domains, our protocol can identify in each firewall the rules that can be removed because of the other firewall. The optimization process involves cooperative computation between the two firewalls without any party disclosing its policy to the other.

In this paper, we study how planar curves converge as they are smoothed with increasing scales. First, two types of convergence behavior are clarified. The coined term <i>shrinkage</i> refers to the reduction of arc-length of a smoothed planar curve, which describes the convergence of the curve latitudinally; and another coined term <i>collapse</i> refers to the movement of each point to its limiting position, which describes the convergence of the curve longitudinally. A systematic study on the shrinkage and collapse of three categories of curve models is then presented. The <i>corner models</i> helps to reveal how the local structures of planar curves collapse and what the smoothed curves may converge to. The <i>sawtooth models</i> allows us to gain insights regarding how noise is suppressed from noisy planar curves by the Gaussian filter. Our investigation on the <i>closed curves</i> shows that each curve collapses to a point at its center of mass. However, different curves may yield different limiting shapes at the infinity scale.

These requirements can become problems in that the Web is visual-centric with regard to presentation as well as information order and layout. This can and does hinder users who need access to information but cannot take advantage of the visual cues available to sighted users.

Recent works in the field of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) show that the user channels decorrelate when the number of antennas at the base stations (BSs) increases, thus strong signal gains are achievable with little interuser interference. Since these results rely on asymptotics, it is important to investigate whether the conventional system models are reasonable in this asymptotic regime. This paper considers a new system model that incorporates general transceiver hardware impairments at both the BSs (equipped with large antenna arrays) and the single-antenna user equipments (UEs). As opposed to the conventional case of ideal hardware, we show that hardware impairments create finite ceilings on the channel estimation accuracy and on the downlink/uplink capacity of each UE. Surprisingly, the capacity is mainly limited by the hardware at the UE, while the impact of impairments in the large-scale arrays vanishes asymptotically and interuser interference (in particular, pilot contamination) becomes negligible.

It extends the Markovian formulation of the rate-distortion optimized (RaDiO) streaming framework by allowing the transmission schedule of a media data unit to become contingent on the acknowledgements relative to other data units. Media decoding dependencies are generally considered in state-of-the-art rate-distortion optimized scheduling algorithms. However, the set of eligible packet schedules are restricted to independent streaming policies, where the transmission strategy envisioned for a data unit at future transmission opportunities only depends on its own acknowledgment, and not on the acknowledgments received for other data units. This paper questions the validity of this assumption in the design of rate-distortion optimal streaming solutions, and provides a first attempt in the formal derivation of the benefit offered by dependent policies. One of the main contributions of our paper is to propose a methodology that limits the search space of dependent policies to relevant dependencies that are likely to bring a rate-distortion benefit, in order to solve an optimization problem that is a priori computationally intractable. Extensive simulations validate the proposed approach that focuses on relevant dependencies between streaming policies. We further show that the benefit of dependent streaming policies is actually marginal in practical scenarios where the gain in distortion per unit of rate decreases along the media decoding dependency path. It represents the first demonstration that the common assumption of independent streaming policies is valid in many common streaming scenarios.

Recent studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of WF attacks through a large number of experiments. However, some researchers believe that the assumptions of WF attacks vastly simplify the problem and are critical in the practical scenarios. In this paper, we assess the threat model of WF and relax the assumptions about browsing behavior to improve the practical feasibility. To deal with the multi-tab browsing scenario, we propose a novel WF attack and identify webpages respectively.

We analyze the anonymous traffic transmitted in the delay and select fine-grained features to identify the first page. Furthermore, we exclude the first page's traffic and utilize coarse features to identify the second page. We deploy our attack in real word environment and the experiment lasts for two months. The Naive Bayes classifier is then applied on the collected datasets to classify the visited websites among 50 top ranked websites in Alexa. When the delay is set to 2 seconds, our attack can classify the first page with 75.9% accuracy, and the second page is 40.5%.

Correct diagnosis requires video-electroencephalography monitoring (VEM) as the diagnosis of PNES is extremely difficult in primary health care. Recent work has demonstrated the usefulness of accelerometry signal taken during a seizure in classification of PNES. In this work, a new direction has been explored to understand the role of different muscles in PNES.

To solve the problem, various divergent routing schemes are used which route the data on centeravoiding divergent routing paths. Though they achieve better load balancing, overall relaying is increased significantly due to their longer routing paths which in turn results into reduced energy efficiency. In this paper, we propose power control as a way of achieving better load balancing in multi-hop wireless networks. We show that when communication range of nodes are properly controlled using power control, better load balancing can be achieved using shortest paths only.

The layers that can be successfully and securely transmitted are determined by the channel states to the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. The advantage of these broadcast approaches is that the transmitter does not need to know the CSI to the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper, but the scheme still adapts to the channel states of the legitimate receiver and the eavesdropper. Three scenarios of block fading wiretap channels with stringent delay constraints are studied, in which either the legitimate receiver's channel, the eavesdropper's channel, or both channels are fading.

Recent advances of transcoding technology make network-I/O bandwidth usages at the server communication ports controllable by request schedulers on the fly. In this article, we propose a transcoding-enabled bandwidth allocation scheme for service differentiation on streaming servers. It aims to deliver high bit rate streams to high priority request classes without overcompromising low priority request classes. We investigate the problem of providing differentiated streaming services at application level in two aspects: stream bandwidth allocation and request scheduling. We formulate the bandwidth allocation problem as an optimization of a harmonic utility function of the stream quality factors and derive the optimal streaming bit rates for requests of different classes under various server load conditions. We prove that the optimal allocation, referred to as harmonic proportional allocation, not only maximizes the system utility function, but also guarantees proportional fair sharing between classes with different prespecified differentiation weights. We evaluate the allocation scheme, in combination with two popular request scheduling approaches, via extensive simulations and compare it with an absolute differentiation strategy and a proportional-share strategy tailored from relative differentiation in networking.

In particular, bleaching of the dye and cell movement impede the analysis and interpretation of imaging results. In this paper, we present methods to tackle these two main artifacts. Cell movement during the experiment is corrected by an optical flow method. Bleaching decay is estimated based on a line fit of recordings without stimulus, which is subtracted from the rest of the recordings in the same experiment.

However, developing aggregation programs is difficult for M2M service providers because it requires gateway-specific knowledge, and consideration must be given to CPU and memory resources. In addition, modifying aggregation logic requires firmware updates, which are risky. We propose a rule-based sensor data aggregation system, called the complex sensor data aggregator (CSDA) for M2M gateways. Data aggregation is categorized into filtering, statistical calculation, and concatenation. The proposed CSDA supports this aggregation process in three steps: the input, data processing, and output steps. The behaviors of these steps are configured by an XML based rule.

In this case, firmware updates are not necessary. The proposed system is evaluated in an M2M gateway experimental environment.

These processes have been linked to differential cortical activation in the left inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) and the left middle temporal gyrus (MTG); however, the particular function of these regions is not yet completely elucidated. We applied transcranial direct current stimulation to the left IFG and the left MTG (or sham stimulation) while participants named pictures in the presence of associatively related, categorically related, or unrelated distractor words. This direct modulation of target regions can help to better delineate the functional role of these regions in lexico-semantic selection. Independent of stimulation, the data show interference (i.e., longer naming latencies) with categorically related distractors and facilitation (i.e., shorter naming latencies) with associatively related distractors. Importantly, stimulation location interacted with the associative effect. Whereas the semantic interference effect did not differ between IFG, MTG, and sham stimulations, the associative facilitation effect was diminished under MTG stimulation. Analyses of latency distributions suggest this pattern to result from a response reversal. Associative facilitation occurred for faster responses, whereas associative interference resulted in slower responses under MTG stimulation. This reduction of the associative facilitation effect under transcranial direct current stimulation may be caused by an unspecific overactivation in the lexicon or by promoting competition among associatively related representations.

In Differential Evolution (DE), large population size, which is much larger than the number of decision variables in problem to be solved, is adopted in order to keep the diversity of search. However, it is difficult to adopt such large size to solve large scaled optimization problems because the population size will become too large and the search efficiency will degrade. In this study, we propose to solve large scale optimization problems using small population size and a large archive for diversity. Also, we propose simple control of scaling factor by observing landscape modality of search points in order to keep diversity. The landscape of a problem to be optimized is often unknown and the landscape is changing dynamically while the search process proceeds. In LMDEa, some points on a line connecting the centroid of search points and a search point are sampled. When the objective values of the sampled points are changed decreasingly and then increasingly, it is thought that one valley exists. If there exists only one valley, the landscape is unimodal and small scaling factor is adopted. Otherwise, large scaling factor is adopted. Also, the sampled points realize global search in the region spanned by all search points and realize local search near the best search point.

Major network disruptions due to disasters - both natural (e.g., Hurricane Sandy, 2011 Japan Tsunami) and human-made (e.g., 9/11 terrorist attack) - deprive the affected population of essential network services for weeks and severely hamper rescue operations. Many techniques exist to provide fast network protection, but they are optimized for limited faults without addressing the extent of disaster failures. Thus, there is a pressing need for novel robust survivability methods to mitigate the effects of disasters on telecom networks.

For instance, methods to re-arrange network resources and services on a partially damaged network, which is the property of a self-organizing network, should be developed, and new algorithms to manage the post-disaster traffic deluge and to relieve the rescue operations after a disaster, with the knowledge of the post-disaster failures, should be investigated.

       " Row(id=194114, manuscriptId=2187585, abstractPaper=u'Filterless Class D amplifiers are based on the tri-state modulation architecture. In this study, the authors show that it is possible to employ the conventional Class D amplifier (that requires an LC output filter) as a filterless amplifier (hence not requiring the LC filter) if certain circuit conditions are satisfied - specifically a sufficiently high carrier frequency and a loudspeaker with sufficient inductance. As the high-frequency (beyond the audio range) components of the tri-state modulation and of the conventional modulation are dissipated in the loudspeaker, the rating of the loudspeaker would need to accommodate not only the audio signal power but also the power, <i>P</i> <sub>sw</sub>, due to the attenuation of the high-frequency components. By means of double-Fourier series analysis, the authors derive expressions for <i>P</i> <sub>sw</sub> and for power-efficiency of filterless Class D amplifiers based on the tri-state modulation and on the conventional modulation. These derived expressions provide meaningful insight into the design and application of these amplifiers, including practical means to improve their power-efficiency and the associated implications thereof. To determine the dissipation of the high-frequency components in the loudspeaker, the authors extend the well established loudspeaker model in the audio range to a high-frequency model, and the required added power rating of the loudspeaker is determined. The authors show, somewhat serendipitously, that if certain conditions are satisfied, the power-efficiency of the tri-state and the conventional filterless amplifiers are nearly comparable.

Such low-duty-cycle operation leads to orders of magnitude longer communication delays in comparison with traditional always-active networks, imposing a new challenge in many time-sensitive sensor network applications (e.g., tracking and alert). In this paper, we introduce novel solutions for bounding sink-to-node communications in energy-harvesting sensor networks.

Due to the the intense memory requirements of rule matching, CPU implementations of the Brill tagging algorithm have been found to be slow. We show that Micron's Automata Processor (AP) - a new computing architecture that can perform massively parallel pattern matching - can greatly accelerate the second stage of Brill tagging via rule template matching. The 218 contextual rules are first converted into regular expressions (regex). Regex is used widely in natural language processing (NLP) tasks, thus, this case study involving Brill Tagging also shows how the AP might accelerate other applications that are able to be framed as regexes. We compare single-threaded, and multithreaded versions of Regex matching on an Intel i7 CPU, an Intel XeonPhi co-processor, and the AP. The results show a 63.90X speed-up using the AP as a regex accelerator over the fastest multi-threaded CPU version. We also investigate how performance of regex matching on both CPU architectures varies depending on the complexity of the regex. Taken together, these results demonstrate the potential for significant performance improvements by using accelerators for various NLP computational tasks, particularly those that involve rule-based or pattern-matching approaches.\", saveSource=u'IEEE', saveTimestamp=datetime.datetime(2016, 7, 2, 15, 46, 54)),\n",

Previously our assembly tool, SWAP-Assembler, can scale to 2048 cores on TianHe 1A for human Yanhuang genome. This work is to further scale SWAP-Assembler to millions of cores on Mira. SWAP-Assembler can be divided into 5 steps, and the most time consuming steps are input parallelization, kmer graph construction, graph simplification (edge merging). We optimize these three steps to keep the percentage of time usage in each step constant when the number of cores increases. For the input parallelization step, the input data is divided into virtual fragments with almost equal size, the begin position and end position for each fragment is automatically separated at the beginning symbol of reads. This data blocking strategy plays a central role in adjusting the data size to keep the communication and memory efficiency for the subsequent steps. In kmer graph construction, to prevent the communication efficiency degradation, the message size is kept constant (about 8k bytes) between any two processes by proportionally increasing the number of nucleotides to the number of processes in the input parallelization step in each round. The memory usage can be also benefited, as only a small part of the input data is processed in each round. Within graph simplification, the major improvement is to combine messages sending &amp; receiving between its two neighbors into one loop in the communication protocol. After integrated with the above optimizations, the new assembly tool is denoted as SWAP-Assembler 2 or SWAP2 for short.
