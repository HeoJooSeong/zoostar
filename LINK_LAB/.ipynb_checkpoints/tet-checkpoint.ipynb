Ordered averages of distributions are defined and it is shown that if a predictor gives an ordered average error term distribution it will be a best IT predictor. Special classes of messages are considered for which a best IT predictor can easily be found, and some examples are given. The error terms which are transmitted in predictive coding are treated as if they were statistically independent. If this is indeed the case, or a good approximation, then it is still necessary to show that sequences of message terms which are statistically independent may always be coded efficiently, without impractically large memory requirements, in order to show that predictive coding may be practical and efficient in such cases. This is done in the final section of this paper.',), (u'An analysis of the detection of repetitive signals in noise by binary integration techniques is made. An expression for the effective signal-to-noise ratio of the quantized video is obtained and is shown to apply to any half-wave second detector. A comparison of analog and digital integration is made, and it is further shown that digital integration is, at most, 1.9 db poorer due to the quantization loss. However, the loss due to nonideal analog integration can make the two types equivalent. The optimum settings for quantizer and counter thresholds are derived, and expressions for the final-detection and false-alarm probabilities are determined. Lastly, the results are modified to include the effect of nonuniform amplitudes in the set of signals being quantized and integrated.',), (u'When reception in the theory of communication is recognized as a problem in statistical inference, system design and system analysis appear as the counterparts of designing and evaluating statistical tests. This paper discusses the optimum properties of designs based on statistical decision theory from the risk point of view, and from that of information theory. Connections between risk and information loss are established, which result in a unified theory of system design. This includes Minimax methods capable in principle of handling all degrees of a priori knowledge of signal and noise statistics, new methods for comparing actual and ideal systems for the same purpose, and new interpretations of previously used formulations as special cases of the more general theory. Both detection and extraction of signals in noise are considered, the former as a problem of testing statistical hypotheses and the latter as one of estimating parameters. Formulation of the general reception problem as a decision operation is followed by a summary of statistical decision theory from the risk point of view, with some examples of Bayes and Minimax tests and optimum classes of decision rules. Applications to detection show the optimum nature of likelihood ratio receivers as a class, and indicate methods for defining the minimum detectable signal and for comparing system performance. As an illustration, curves of Bayes and Minimax risk are given for detection of a pulsed carrier in noise. Applications to extraction show the nature of optimum extraction and the roles of the mean square error and maximum likelihood criteria from the more general point of view of risk theory. Conditions under which information loss is an extremum in detection and extraction are established, and information loss itself as a criterion of performance is compared with that of the risk measure.',), (u'A survey of existing lumped parameter and distributed parameter delay lines has shown that their maximum. storage capacity is about 23 pulses and 15 pulses respectively regardless of total delay time. An analysis of pulse transmission through distributed delay lines indicates that dissipation in the inductive elements is the chief factor limiting storage capacity. A method is proposed for decreasing this dissipation through the use of high-Q nickel zinc ferrites around straight conductors for inductive elements.',))\n"

Since the detection process suppresses the temporal variations of the weaker signals in one portion of the output spectrum and the stronger signals in another, it is possible, under certain conditions, to effectively separate the modulation information of the original signals.',), (u'Many investigators have for several years been studying the use of rectangular loop magnetic cores as memory elements. It seems profitable at this time to examine, from a dimensional point of view, the various selection systems which have been developed, and to find the relations between their operating principles.',), (u'In Part I predictive coding was defined and messages, prediction, entropy, and ideal coding were discussed. In the present paper the criterion to be used for predictors for the purpose of predictive coding is defined: that predictor is optimum in the information theory (IT) sense which minimizes the entropy of the average error-term distribution. Ordered averages of distributions are defined and it is shown that if a predictor gives an ordered average error term distribution it will be a best IT predictor. Special classes of messages are considered for which a best IT predictor can easily be found, and some examples are given. The error terms which are transmitted in predictive coding are treated as if they were statistically independent. If this is indeed the case, or a good approximation, then it is still necessary to show that sequences of message terms which are statistically independent may always be coded efficiently, without impractically large memory requirements, in order to show that predictive coding may be practical and efficient in such cases. This is done in the final section of this paper.',), (u'An analysis of the detection of repetitive signals in noise by binary integration techniques is made. An expression for the effective signal-to-noise ratio of the quantized video is obtained and is shown to apply to any half-wave second detector. A comparison of analog and digital integration is made, and it is further shown that digital integration is, at most, 1.9 db poorer due to the quantization loss. However, the loss due to nonideal analog integration can make the two types equivalent. The optimum settings for quantizer and counter thresholds are derived, and expressions for the final-detection and false-alarm probabilities are determined. Lastly, the results are modified to include the effect of nonuniform amplitudes in the set of signals being quantized and integrated.',), (u'When reception in the theory of communication is recognized as a problem in statistical inference, system design and system analysis appear as the counterparts of designing and evaluating statistical tests. This paper discusses the optimum properties of designs based on statistical decision theory from the risk point of view, and from that of information theory. Connections between risk and information loss are established, which result in a unified theory of system design. This includes Minimax methods capable in principle of handling all degrees of a priori knowledge of signal and noise statistics, new methods for comparing actual and ideal systems for the same purpose, and new interpretations of previously used formulations as special cases of the more general theory. Both detection and extraction of signals in noise are considered, the former as a problem of testing statistical hypotheses and the latter as one of estimating parameters. Formulation of the general reception problem as a decision operation is followed by a summary of statistical decision theory from the risk point of view, with some examples of Bayes and Minimax tests and optimum classes of decision rules. Applications to detection show the optimum nature of likelihood ratio receivers as a class, and indicate methods for defining the minimum detectable signal and for comparing system performance. As an illustration, curves of Bayes and Minimax risk are given for detection of a pulsed carrier in noise. Applications to extraction show the nature of optimum extraction and the roles of the mean square error and maximum likelihood criteria from the more general point of view of risk theory. Conditions under which information loss is an extremum in detection and extraction are established, and information loss itself as a criterion of performance is compared with that of the risk measure.',), (u'A survey of existing lumped parameter and distributed parameter delay lines has shown that their maximum. storage capacity is about 23 pulses and 15 pulses respectively regardless of total delay time. An analysis of pulse transmission through distributed delay lines indicates that dissipation in the inductive elements is the chief factor limiting storage capacity. A method is proposed for decreasing this dissipation through the use of high-Q nickel zinc ferrites around straight conductors for inductive elements.',))\n"
